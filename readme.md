### Simple and Clean Arch Linux i3wm Nord dotÂ´s

![](https://wwv.christian.re/demo-desktop.jpg)

Simple and easy dot's for Arch Linux with i3wm that I use on my work PC in my office.

Since it is a work computer, I paid attention to cleanliness, usefulness and beauty and not to unnecessary bells and whistles.

**Important**. This is not a finished version. I'm still working on it and so there are no installation instructions or anything else. I advise against using them at the moment.
